    <h2>My Personal Life</h2>
    <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p>I was brought to this world without my consent, by one Mr. and Mrs Ajibare in Ondo State, Nigeria.<br>
        I do not remember much of my early childhood, but my mum said I was a very active, curious, smart and impressive child.
      </p><br>

    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>Growing up my thirst for knowledge did not come to an end. I was passionate about science especially human anatomy.</p><br>

     <h3>Relationship Status </h3>
    I'm definitely not married yet!

    <h3> My Hobbies</h3>

    Driving and cruising with loud pop music.<br>
     Swimming in a pool filled with women.<br>
     Learning new skills.<br>
